# OCL (OpenCampaignLink)
Open Campaign Link is an open standard under development by IPRD Solutions to enable the monitoring and treatment of health conditions that depend critically on longitudinal patient information or that are interconnected with other campaigns designed to impact global health.

Open Campaign Link (OCL) can be used to generate a machine-readable OCL QR Code and a human-readable OCL Short Code that encodes and indexes information that a solution provider believes will be useful in their own or other campaigns.

Patients can keep a digital or printed copy of their OCL QR Code and OCL Short Code, much like they keep a favorite family photo, to help patients, physicians, clinics or test services using OCL-compatible solutions to use or locate their health information. A solution provider can elect to use patient-privacy-preserving options as they generate OCL Codes.
